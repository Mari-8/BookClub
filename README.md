# BookClub 


Welcome to BookClub! The main focus is just a place to keep track of your favorite books, keep track of what you have already read, categorize your shelves ( Fiction, Self Development, My finished books, etc. ), and Have discussions with other users on a public board. 

Categorizing and keeping track of the books is the key, so you will not be able to add a book until you have a shelf to put it on.
Adding a brand new book utilizes the googlebooks gem. As of right now, it is mostly accurate. It doesn't fetch the right book 100% of the time, but if you have any problems you can manually add the book info.

I am planning on continuing to improve BookClub, and possibly hosting it eventually.
